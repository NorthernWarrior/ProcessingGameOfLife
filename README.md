# Conway's Game of Life

This is a simple implementation of "Conway's Game of Life" made with [Processing](https://processing.org/).
You can find more information about the rules for this cellular automaton on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Key bindings:

- **"r"** - runs the "simulation", the speed is determined by the "genTriggerTime" variable, pressing "r" again will stop it
- **"c"** - clears the whole screen
- **"g"** - if the simulation is stopped, then the next generation will be evaluated (step-bystep)
- **"h"** - show indicators for next cell states
- **"0"** ... "9" - increase or decrease grid size

When the simulation is not running, you can draw new cells with the left mouse button and delete cells with the right mouse button.
